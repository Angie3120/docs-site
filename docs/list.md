# List a Trading Pair

## How can a trading pair be created?
So far Binance DEX still adheres to the idea that the most efficient and low cost way to perform trading and price-discovery is still to use single order book. This single order book is managed and replicated across all full nodes with the same, deterministic matching logic.
Simply allowing trading between two assets sounds 'perfect', however it is expensive for not only the network runners but also the users in long term (liquidity cost can be much larger). In order to efficiently use the network, Binance Chain only list assets against BNB and other widely accepted market benchmark assets. After an asset is issued, anyone can "propose" to all validators to list it against particular benchmark assets. Validators would vote to accept the proposal. Fee would be charged to prevent abuse of the proposing and endorse the asset. Once the proposal is accepted, the owner of the base asset can list the trading pair via interfaces.
