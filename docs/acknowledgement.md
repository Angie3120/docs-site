# Acknowledgements

Binance Chain has been through several iterations and evolutions, each time building upon work contributed by the amazing members of the blockchain community. We would like to acknowledge the outstanding work that we have been able to build on during development. Let's build the future together!

## Binance Dexathon

The Binance Dexathon concluded in September 2018, receiving prize winning submissions from teams that sent in some really impressive projects. Our internal work on Binance Chain was taking place in parallel to this and we are delighted to say that many of the projects helped to improve the final product.

## Tendermint and Cosmos

Our current implementation is built on forks of Tendermint and Cosmos SDK. We make use of a revised edition of Tendermint consensus and leverage its p2p networking logic, and Cosmos SDK features such as its "bank" is used for basic token transactions.

Projects like Binance Chain and Binance DEX are often built as forks of Bitcoin or as smart contracts on platforms like Ethereum. With a foundation of clean, well-structured code from Cosmos SDK, we were able to build on a codebase that we saw as a cleaner and well thought-out alternative. Many thanks to the Cosmos developers and its community for their work (and for being really helpful in our issues and pull requests!)
