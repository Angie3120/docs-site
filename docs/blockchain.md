# Binance Chain as A Blockchain

The purpose of the new blockchain and DEX is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing and exchanging digital assets amongst everyone in the world in a decentralized manner. 

## Technology Stack

As Blockchain, essentially Binance Chain is a p2p network, with multiple clients on it to reach consensus on data state.

## Node Roles

#### What is a Validator?

Validators are a group of IT infrastructure who take the responsibility to maintain the Binance Chain/DEX data and validate all the transactions. They would join the consensus procedure and vote to produce blocks. The fees would be collected and distributed among all validators. You can consider Validator as "miner" in Bitcoin and Ethereum and similar concepts exist in dPoS blockchains  EOS and dBFT in NEO. The initial validators are selected from trusted members of the Binance community, and will eventually expand to more members as the Binance blockchain and ecosystem matures, this responsibility will be distributed. The decentralized governance procedure would be introduced and executed. More qualified organization/individual can become Validator.
