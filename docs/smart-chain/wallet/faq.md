# Binance Extension Wallet FAQ
## Tokens not visible after withdrawing from Binance


Many users who interact with a centralized exchange like Binance eventually want to withdraw to a wallet that they fully control, like MetaMask. So once you've used their withdraw form, what could be scarier than not seeing your tokens?

First, you'll need to use the MetaMask add Custom Network feature to add the Binance Chain or Binance Smart Chain's RPC URLs endpoints to your MetaMask. 

Once you've added the Binance Chain or the Binance Smart Chain to your MetaMask, you will be able to select different networks to view the assets (you may need to add Custom Tokens too) held by your selected account on that network.

Eventually, MetaMask looks forward to making it easier for you to view assets from various networks all at once, but for now, it's good to understand where your assets are really controlled, and make your own decisions about where to withdraw them.

## How Much BNB You Need To Send Tokens

if you try to send tokens without having any BNB in your account you will be told you have insufficient funds. This means you do not have enough BNB in your account to cover the cost of gas. Each transaction (including token and contract transactions) require gas and that gas is paid in BNB. You can think of this like a transaction fee.

You can remedy this by sending 0.001 BNB to that account in order to be able to make the transaction.

A standard Ether transfer TX will be 21000 gas & a gas price of 8 GWEI.
With tokens, the amount of gas is typically 200000 gas, so the total TX fee increases to 0.001 ETH - 0.002 ETH.
