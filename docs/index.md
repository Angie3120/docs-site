## What is Binance Chain, or Binance DEX

Binance Chain is the blockchain initially developed by Binance and community. 
Binance DEX is the decentralized exchange module developed on top of the Binance Chain blockchain. 


## What can I do with Binance Chain

The purpose of the new blockchain and DEX is to create an alternative marketplace for issuing 
and exchanging digital assets amongst everyone in the world in a decentralized manner.

You can:

- Send and receive BNB
- Issue new tokens to digitalize assets, and use Binance Chain as underlying exchange/transfer 
network for the assets
- Send, receive, burn/mint and freeze/unfreeze tokens 
- Propose to create trading pairs between two different tokens
- Send orders to buy or sell assets through trading pairs created on the chain
- Watch the DEX market to confirm price and market activity of certain assets

You can also:

- Explore the transaction history and blocks on the chain, via Binance Chain Explorer, API 
and node RPC interfaces.
- Run a full node to listen to and broadcast live updates on transactions, blocks, and consensus activities
- Extract other data of Binance Chain via full node or APIs
- Apply to run a validator node
- Develop tools and application to help users use Binance Chain and Binance DEX

In the future, you may be able to:

- stake your BNB to join Chain Governance
- and other exciting new features!
