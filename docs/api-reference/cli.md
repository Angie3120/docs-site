# Command Line Interface (CLI)

Binance Chain CLI is one of ways to access Binance Chain.

Binance Chain CLI can be used as a local wallet, you can manage your keys via Binance CLI. You can add a new
key or restore your key from mnemonic words. And you can list your keys and show specified key info. 

With Binance Chain CLI, you can send transactions to Binance Chain, like placing order, transferring token, 
issuing token and so on. Actually you can do almost everything you can do with Binance Chain web wallet. What is
more, you can propose to list trading pairs and join chain governance.

In addition, you can do some simple queries through CLI. For example, you can query your account's 
balance, transaction detail by transaction hash and etc.

## Where can I download the Binance Chain CLI?

You can download Binance Chain CLI releases here: [https://github.com/binance-chain/node-binary](https://github.com/binance-chain/node-binary)

Source code will be released soon after pending security audits have been completed.

### CLI installation

Once you have downloaded the binary for your platform, you may drop it into any folder you like. Open a terminal window or `cmd.exe` in that folder, and then follow the examples on the documentation site.

```bash
$  ./bnbcli
```

On Windows you would most likely use this instead:

```bash
C:\> bnbcli.exe
```

## Where to connect

You can manage you keys locally without connecting to any node. But if you want to interact with Binance Chain, 
you need to connect to one of Binance Chain full nodes. 

You can run your own full node, which may automatically connect to Binance Chain, and you can run your CLI there 
with your own full node. In the mean time, you can connect to any full nodes provided by other people. Please 
check [here] (dataseed_list.md) for a list.

Full nodes will be denoted as the format of `ip:port`.

## How to use
